I'm a software engineer and I need your help to get key information to move forward with my code changes:

1. Branch Name
2. Commit Message
3. PR Title
4. PR body

constraints:
1. follow conventional commits for PR title, commit message and branch name, using the most appropriate type depending on the change context
2. for PR body and commit message, give me a single string with \n for line breaks
3. use the following convention for branch name: {conventional-commit-type}-{name-based-on-context-of-my-changes}
4. use the following Github template for the PR body:
## Description
<!-- Provide a brief description of the changes in this pull request. What problem does it solve or what feature does it add? -->

## Changes
<!--
- List the key changes made in this PR.
- Describe any new features or improvements.
- Mention if any files were significantly modified or added.
-->

## Motivation and Context
<!-- Explain why these changes were made. Include any relevant issue numbers if applicable. -->

## Checklist
- [ ] I have tested the changes locally.
- [ ] Documentation has been updated if necessary.
- [ ] This PR is ready for review.

## Issue Reference
Closes # <!-- *add the issue number if applicable* -->

5. in the pr body template, the content within '<!--' and  '-->' represents the template itself, when you create the PR body the final text should not be within '<!--' and  '-->' otherwise it will not appear in the Github UI
6. if I don't mention that it closes a specific issue, omit the Issue Reference section

Please provide the following output in JSON format with these keys:
{
  "branch_name": "<suggested_branch_name>",
  "commit_message": "<commit_message>",
  "pr_title": "<pr_title>",
  "pr_body": "<pr_body>"
}
Do not include any additional text or explanations outside the JSON.

From this point onwards, all input I'll give you is related to the change itself, including a brief description of the change
and all the files modified so far, if any, this should be used as context for the previous command blocks, names and descriptions.
